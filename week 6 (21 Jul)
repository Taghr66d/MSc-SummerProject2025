Outlines:
- Discuss the progress with the supervisor.
- Try other method with apply SNR 5-20 
- Try harder learning (real noise)
- Analyse the result
- start MLy injection and test with simulation noise 

What have done:
- Accurecy on Ligo Simulation noise 99% with (10k samples for each class and SNR 5-20)
- Test on real noise obtain 50% ( need to fine tune more)
- Anlaysis the result (the signal cusp vs blip features: power, rms, peak, zero_crossings, centroid, bandwidth) to 
  build model if the curent model fail on real noise. 
- Test SNR 5-50 with enhance the CNN model with real noise (curriculum leraning)

Need to check:
- What have been done so far up to week 5 with the supervisor.
- 

Next Week's plan:
