# MSc-SummerProject2025
Project Aim:
- The aim of this project is to build a novel conventional neural network classification layers to predict the GW signal according to its sources (parameter estimation)

Objectives:
Week 1: (Data)
- generate the data (simulating through...)
- preprocessing (Whitening, Windowing...)
- splitting data (training, testing, validating)
  
Week 2: (CNN's Layers)
- Establish the network
- Lit. Review (Hyperparameter)

Week 3: (
