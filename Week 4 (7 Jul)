Outlines:
- Generate many different “flavors” of cusp signals (Have different amplitudes and frequency cutoffs)
- Generate many blip glitch samples.
- start training on CNN
- Analyse the result

What have done:
- Generate the cusp Vs glitch (each 10,000 (70% training - 15% Validation - 15% Test)
- Start training CNN model
- 

Need to check:
- Check if the sample rate for both signal and noise = 1024? 
- Ligo grid access!
