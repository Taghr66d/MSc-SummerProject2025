Outlines:
- Generate many different “flavors” of cusp signals (Have different amplitudes and frequency cutoffs)
- Generate many blip glitch samples.
- start training on CNN
- Analyse the result

What have done:
- The signal has exactly the expected matched-filter SNR.
- Generate the cusp Vs glitch (each 10,000 (70% training - 15% Validation - 15% Test)
- Start training CNN model
