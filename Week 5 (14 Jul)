Outlines:
- Try to generate cusp signals 60k with curriculum learning (SNR 5-100)
- Generate many blip glitch samples in the same way.
- Start training on CNN (Ligo grid if need it)
- Analyse the result

What have done:
- Generate the cusp Vs glitch (each 60,000 (70% training - 15% Validation - 15% Test)
SNR 5 satges from 5-100 as curriculum learning.
- Start training the CNN model (obtain accurecy 100%) (need to check overvitting)
- Read more about MLy pipline

Need to check:
- The accurecy obtain 100% --> overvitting or easy noise need to increase or apply real noise
- Ligo grid access!
- Discussing other decomposition methods like EMD with supervisor!

Next Week's plan:
- Enhance the Deep Learning method by increase the number of samples ~ 100k
- Try different methods.. (supervisor suggestions) 
- more challenge training --> real noise
