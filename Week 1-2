Outlines:
- prepare the data
- read more about Cosmic String Cusps
- Generate Cusps signal (from scratch by theoretical part)
- Generate glitch close to CSC shape or just noise
- Save the sample

What have done:
- generate cusps model
- normlised
- injected into the noise 

Need to check:
- if the Cusps Def. is correct or need modify 
- if start the CNN with time domain and start train on small samples
- if glitch better idea than the noise

Next Week plan:
- Start Build the Deep Learning method
- Read more about it 
- Try to train samall
