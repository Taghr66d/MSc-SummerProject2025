Outlines:
- modify current code to properly normalize cosmic string signal using the standard SNR definition
(frequency-domain, PSD-weighted), as the supervisor suggested
- Read more about CNN architecture works on Time-domain wave-model
- Generate many different “flavors” of cusp signals (Have different amplitudes and frequency cutoffs)
- Save the sample 
- start training
- Analyse the result

What have done:
- The signal has exactly the expected matched-filter SNR.
- Generate the sample Vs Noise (~6000 split 50% signal with noise and 50% noise)
- Start training 
- 

Need to check:
- if the CNN architecture need to fit or close to MLy 
- if need read deeply about MLy early better? or just focus on mine and then compare!
- 

Next Week plan:
- Enhance the Deep Learning method by increase the number of samples ~ 100k
- Read more about it 
- Try to train 
- Analyse & Write about the result
